All about GitHub !
============================================================

# What is Git ?
-Git is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus Torvalds—the same person who created Linux. 
-Git is similar to other version control systems—Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial to name a few.

# What is Hub ?
-Git is a command-line tool, but the center around which all things involving Git revolve is the hub—GitHub.com—
 where developers store their projects and network with like minded people.

# What is GitHub ?
-GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. 
-GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly.
-While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. 
-It also provides access control and several collaboration features, 
 such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.


GitHub essentials are:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Repositories
2. Branches
3. Commits
4. Pull Requests
5. Git (the version control software GitHub is built on)

Repository
===================================================================
A GitHub repository can be used to store a development project.
It can contain folders and any type of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Documents, Data, Images).
A GitHub repository should also include a licence file and a README file about the project.
A GitHub repository can also be used to store ideas, or any resources that you want to share.


Branches
=================================================================== 
When you're working on a project, you're going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given time – 
some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. 
Branching exists to help you manage this workflow.
When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas. 
Changes you make on a branch don't affect the master branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes, 
safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're collaborating with.


Commits
===================================================================
At GitHub, changes are called commits.
Each commit (change) has a description explaining why a change was made.
Commit Command:
This operation helps you to save the changes in your file. 
When you commit a file, you should always provide the message, just to keep in the mind the changes done by you. 
Though this message is not compulsory but it is always recommended so that it can differentiate the various versions or commits you have done so far to your repository. 
These commit messages maintain the history of changes which in turn help other contributors to understand the file better. 


Follow the below steps:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
-Click on “readme- changes” file which we have just created.
-Click on the “edit” or a pencil icon in the righmost corner of the file.
-Once you click on that, an editor will open where you can type in the changes or anything.  
-Write a commit message which identifies your changes.
-Click commit changes in the end. 


Pull Requests
=======================================================================
Pull Requests are the heart of GitHub collaboration.
With a pull request you are proposing that your changes should be merged (pulled in) with the master.
Pull requests show content differences, changes, additions, and subtractions in colors (green and red).
As soon as you have a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.


# How github works
Step 1. Create a Repository
Step 2. Create a Branch
Step 3. Make and commit changes
Step 4. Open a Pull Request
Step 5. Merge your Pull Request


# Some other terminologies

## Cloning  
Suppose you want to use some code which is present in a public repository, 
you can directly copy the contents by cloning or downloading.


## Forking 
The flagship functionality of GitHub is “forking” – copying a repository from one user’s account to another. 
This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. 


## making PR’s
If you make changes you’d like to share, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner. 


## Merge 
That user can then, with a click of a button, merge the changes found in your repo with the original repo.
Click on “Merge pull request” to merge the changes into master branch.
Click “Confirm merge”.
You can delete the branch once all the changes have been incorporated and if there are no conflicts. 


## Opening issues
When you open an issue from code, the issue contains a snippet showing the line or range of code you chose.
You can only open an issue in the same repository where the code is stored.
