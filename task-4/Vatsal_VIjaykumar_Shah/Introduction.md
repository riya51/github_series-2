Hey, 
My name is Vatsal Shah.

I am currently pursuing Btech in Cse from Dit University.
My hobbies include video games and trekking. 
This is the first time I am creating a repository and I am currently learning on how to work on Github.
This is the day 4 of the task and i have learnt many new things in this series.


Regards,
Vatsal Vijaykumar Shah
